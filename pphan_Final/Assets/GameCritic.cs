/*
	1.  Is the game too easy or hard?  Give 2 unique reasons why it is easy or hard.
		The game is too easy due to play character only needs to be moved left or right, and there are not enough obstacles for the game to be challenging.

	2.  What 2 changes would you do to make it easier or harder?
		To make the game harder, I would add more obstacles and speed them up; also, I would also make the play character to be able to move back and forth as well.

	3.  List 2 things that would give it a "wow" factor.
		One thing would be the implementation of sounds, and the other would be a jump feature for the player to jump over obstacles.

	4.  What 2 parts of the game are fun?
		It is fun to collect powerup; it's also fun to watch the special effect of the powerup.

	5.  What 2 parts of the game are tedious?
		It is very tedious to move the character after it is being hit by the obstacle due to temporary slow movement.  It is also tedious to repeat the process 
		of only avoiding obstacle and getting powerup over and over again.

		CHANGES WERE MADE TO THE OBSTACLE AND POWERUP PICKUPS:
		The Obstacle was changed from a red cube into a larger and intimidating black spike ball.
		The Powerup's Particle System was changed with follow:
			1.  Rate over Time of Emission was changed from 30 to 88.
			2.  Radius of Shape was changed from 1 to 1.5.
			3.  Color over Lifetime was changing to gold.
