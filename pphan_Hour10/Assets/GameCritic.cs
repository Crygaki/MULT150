IMPROVING THE GAME QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS:

Is the game too easy or hard?
The game is too easy because there is no lose condition, so the player can just play until they win.

What would make it easier or harder?
Implement at least a lose condition would make the game harder.

What would give it a "wow" factor?
The game is called Chaos Ball, so it would be amazinng to have explosions of the chaos balls!

What parts of the game are fun?  What parts of the game are tedious?
The game is fun on balls colliding with each other and moving in random directions.  
The game is not fun with the current character speed, which is slow and 
can barely catch up with the balls, especially the chaotic ones, so the balls automatically 
go into the goals most of the times without the player even touch them.

4 SELECTED SUGGESTIONS AND 1 EXTRA (QUIT BUTTON) HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED INTO THE GAME:

1. A timer has been added to the game that let the player competes for a shorter time of completion.

2. A chaos goal has been added to the game in between the red and blue goals, and it is also part of the winning requirement.

3. The bumper's shape has been changed to a moon shape for easier control the ball direction upon contact.

4. A replay button has been added to the game that let the player replays the game without exiting.

5. A quit button has been added to the game that let the player exits the game immediately.
